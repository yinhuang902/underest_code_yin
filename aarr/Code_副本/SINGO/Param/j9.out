WARNING: NLP resolve is now enabled by default. The EnableNLPResolve() method will be removed in a future release.
WARNING: The curly syntax (sum{},prod{},norm2{}) is deprecated in favor of the new generator syntax (sum(),prod(),norm()).
WARNING: Replace sum{qcoeffs[definedB[j]] * definedBilinearVars[j],j in 1:length(definedB)} with sum(qcoeffs[definedB[j]] * definedBilinearVars[j] for j in 1:length(definedB)).
WARNING: Replace sum{qcoeffs[newB[j]] * bilinearVars_local_con[j],j in 1:length(newB)} with sum(qcoeffs[newB[j]] * bilinearVars_local_con[j] for j in 1:length(newB)).
WARNING: Replace sum{(y[j,numOfDisc * (i - 1)] - (data[j].abundance[1])[i]) ^ 2,i = 1:lt0} with sum((y[j,numOfDisc * (i - 1)] - (data[j].abundance[1])[i]) ^ 2 for i = 1:lt0).
WARNING: Replace sum{(y[numOfDisc * (i - 1)] - (data[j].abundance[1])[i + ind_start]) ^ 2,i = 1:length(t)} with sum((y[numOfDisc * (i - 1)] - (data[j].abundance[1])[i + ind_start]) ^ 2 for i = 1:length(t)).
WARNING: Replace sum{(y[numOfDisc * (i - 1)] - (data[j].abundance[1])[i + ind_start]) ^ 2,i = 2:length(t)} with sum((y[numOfDisc * (i - 1)] - (data[j].abundance[1])[i + ind_start]) ^ 2 for i = 2:length(t)).
WARNING: A variable named x is already attached to this model. If creating variables programmatically, consider using the anonymous variable syntax x = @variable(m, [1:N], ...).
WARNING: A variable named bilinear is already attached to this model. If creating variables programmatically, consider using the anonymous variable syntax x = @variable(m, [1:N], ...).
