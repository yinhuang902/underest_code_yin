    Given a node, collect the LB solutions and average.

    Method: 
        (1) get lifted var solutions from each LB subproblem solution.
        (2) average 

    NOTE: this method will always return a "feasible" candidate - i.e.,
            as long as we have a solution to the LB subproblems,
            we can generate a candidate solution and return it.
            ** as long as the round_binaries flag is enabled
    
    NOTE: the candidate solution objective will be None, because we do not
            solve an optimization in this case.

    NOTE: in the context of booleans, we round:
        - if > 0.5  -> 1
        - if <= 0.5 -> 0

    Given a node, collect the LB solutions and find the variance across

    Method:

        (2) normalize solution, if indicated
        (3) compute the variance across the solutions 

    NOTE: In the case of continuous domains, we normalize by default such that we can
    easily compare the variance against binary domains as well.

    We define the variance as:

        var = 1/frequency * (sum(x_i - avg(x)) ^ 2 for i in subproblems containing x)

        avg(x):     average solution of x across all subproblems containing x

    We first compute the sum for the subproblems containing x on this rank,
